    "para": "Fluoride treatments are a vital part of preventive dental care, often recommended by professionals after cleanings to strengthen enamel and protect against cavities. By replenishing essential minerals, fluoride helps fortify teeth, making them more resistant to decay and acid erosion. These treatments are especially beneficial for individuals at higher risk of cavities, such as children, seniors, and those with weakened enamel. While widely endorsed for their effectiveness, insurance coverage for fluoride treatments can vary, making it important to check with providers. As a simple yet powerful defense against tooth decay, fluoride treatments continue to play a key role in maintaining lifelong oral health."
